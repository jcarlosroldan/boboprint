# Hannya Labs

3D printing studio with custom design and hand painting, based in Seville. Static site hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Register hannyalabs.com domain (OVH)
- [ ] Configure custom domain in GitHub Pages

Orders and communication happen through WhatsApp and Instagram (buttons already on the site). If the business grows enough to need a proper catalog, checkout, and order tracking, migrate to Shopify rather than bolting services onto the static site.
